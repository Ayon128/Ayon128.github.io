# Hello, I'm Md. Ayon Mia

I am currently working as a Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at [Dhaka International University](https://diu.ac.bd/). I earned my B.Sc. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Chittagong University of Engineering & Technology with a GPA of 3.83/4.00 (7th position).
My research interests are primarily in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Multimodal Learning. In the field of NLP, I focus on areas such as low-resource languages, code-mixed language translation, sentiment analysis, and text classification. I have extensive experience working with transformer-based models and have participated in various shared tasks focusing on cross-lingual applications. Additionally, I have also explored several important topics in Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) including feature fusion techniques, pooling strategies, and model optimization for low-resource settings.
